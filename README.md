# Nextjs Tutorial
I am working through the [NextJS Dashboard Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) to get a greater understanding of the platform for a personal project that I am working on.

## Usage instructions
To use this app, following the steps below:  
1.) Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/ryanjoprod/nextjs_tutorial.git`  
2.) Run `npm install`  
3.) Run `npm run dev`  
4.) Navigate to `localhost:3000` in the web browser of your choice.  

The steps above assume that you have a current version of[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine already.
